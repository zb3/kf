### What's this?

This is an experiment puyo puyo like game written in HTML5 and CSS3, that does not use the canvas element, and tries to be as responsive as possible. Supports both keyboard and touch controls, and tries to adapt to any screen size (see known problems).
This is an experiment to see how a game development in CSS3 looks like.

### What are the controls?

Arrow keys for movement, `p` for pausing, `n` for new game
Touch controls should be intuitive, therefore either they work as you would think they do, or they need to be rewritten :)

### Known problems

- Everything often looks blurred (because of CSS3 scale transform)
- Animations sometimes off by 1px in chrome
- Colors are boring

Keep in mind that this is an experiment and CSS is itself changing quickly.

### Solutions to these

- JS part could dynamically change sizes of elements so that global scale could go away
- `onresize` would of course abort animations

However, I won't implement them, that's for the reader, I have to stay creative and do something new :)

### Eww, what a horribly formatted code!

Well, I use different format for editing the code, which sometimes depends on semantics etc...
At first I wanted to include a format switch but currently it's impossible as I wouldn't be able to switch back to my style because no js format tool supports that.
